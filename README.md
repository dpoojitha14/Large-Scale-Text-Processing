# Large-Scale-Text-Processing
CSE 587 - Data Intensive Computing (Spring 2017)

Implemented word count on tweets.
Implemented word co-occurrence on the collected tweets.

Activity 1: Word co-occurrence on Classical Latin Text
For each word in the text, normalization is performed by replacing j with i and v with u.
If the lemmatizer contains the normalized word, a list of lemmas are obtained and a key value pair is created from the lemma and
the location. Otheriwise, the normalized spelling is used for the creation of key-value pair.

Activity 2: Word co-occurrence for 3-grams
